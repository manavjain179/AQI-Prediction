The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measure of air quality that is widely used to inform the public about the level of air pollution and associated health risks. Accurate prediction of AQI is crucial for environmental monitoring and public health management. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning algorithms to predict AQI based on historical data and weather parameters. This research paper explores the application of various machine learning techniques, including regression models, decision trees, and neural networks, to predict AQI based on weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. The study analyzes the performance of different models on a dataset of historical air quality data and weather data collected web scrapping. This work focuses on performing data collection by web scrapping, data cleaning and leverages various models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost and Artificial Neural Networks for AQI prediction. This research paper has important implications for air quality management, providing a framework for developing effective prediction models to support environmental monitoring and public health policies.
